# BoxPilot architecture

## Product boundary

BoxPilot is a local-first management plane for one Ubuntu server. The normal operator uses a browser from another LAN or Tailscale device. Cloud accounts are optional integrations, not a requirement for operating the server.

Version `0.1.0` contains only the browser application and an unprivileged read-only API. The privileged execution layer described below is a design target, not a shipped capability.

## Target components

```text
Browser over Tailscale HTTPS
          |
          v
BoxPilot web and API process (unprivileged)
          |
          +---- SQLite state, job history, approvals, audit log
          |
          +---- Read-only collectors
          |       systemd, journald, SMART, Docker, libvirt, Tailscale
          |
          v
Restricted helper over a local Unix socket (future)
          |
          +---- typed apt operations
          +---- typed systemd operations
          +---- typed firewall operations
          +---- typed storage and backup operations
          +---- adapter-owned Docker and libvirt operations
```

The web process must never accept an arbitrary command string for privileged execution. The helper receives validated operation names and typed parameters, applies an allowlist, records an audit event, and returns structured output.

## Change lifecycle

Every mutation is a durable job with these states:

```text
draft -> preflight -> checkpointed -> awaiting approval -> applying
      -> verifying -> completed
                    -> rollback available -> rolled back
                    -> failed
```

An operation cannot enter `applying` without:

1. A successful preflight tied to the current host state
2. A verified recovery checkpoint when the adapter requires one
3. An explicit, short-lived approval from an authorized operator
4. An operation-specific rollback or recovery explanation

## Trust boundaries

### Browser

- Never receives host credentials, cloud client secrets, backup passphrases, or raw environment files
- Uses anti-CSRF protection and a short authenticated session
- Shows redacted diffs and structured command plans
- Requires reauthentication for high-impact approvals

### Web and API process

- Runs as a dedicated unprivileged user
- Binds to loopback by default
- Does not mount `/var/run/docker.sock`
- Cannot invoke `sudo`
- Stores encrypted integration secrets separately from ordinary job data
- Redacts secret-like values before persistence and display

### Privileged helper

- Runs as a separate, minimal system service
- Listens only on a root-owned Unix socket
- Accepts no shell fragments or arbitrary paths
- Enforces operation-specific path roots and argument schemas
- Has no inbound network listener
- Emits an append-only audit record for every request

## Access model

The recommended path is:

1. BoxPilot listens on `127.0.0.1:8787`.
2. Tailscale Serve provides private HTTPS inside the tailnet.
3. Tailscale Funnel remains disabled.
4. BoxPilot authentication remains required even when Tailscale is present.
5. LAN listening is opt-in and requires TLS or a trusted reverse proxy.

Tailscale provides the private network path. It does not replace application authorization, audit trails, or reauthentication for destructive changes.

## Adapter contract

Each managed application adapter owns:

- Discovery and version detection
- Configuration inventory with secret redaction
- Health checks and acceptance criteria
- Backup and restore procedures
- Migration compatibility checks
- Upgrade plan and rollback instructions
- Log sources and support-bundle redaction rules

The Keel Notes adapter is first because it exercises databases, managed secrets, file storage, Docker, backups, restore testing, and migration.

## Data model target

The initial persistent store will be SQLite with these logical records:

- hosts
- workloads
- adapters and capabilities
- plans and plan revisions
- jobs and job steps
- approvals
- checkpoints
- backup artifacts and restore drills
- audit events
- redaction rules

Backup repositories, VM images, database dumps, and application data do not live inside the BoxPilot database. BoxPilot stores their metadata, validation results, and destination references.

## Backup rule

A successful copy is not a verified backup. BoxPilot reports a workload as protected only when:

- The adapter knows every required data and secret component
- The last backup completed without excluded critical paths
- Artifact integrity checks passed
- Encryption and recovery keys meet policy
- A restore drill passed within the configured interval

## Version 0.1.0 limitations

- Dashboard values are demonstration data.
- Compose inspection is a lightweight browser-only scan, not a full YAML policy engine.
- The API exposes prototype health and capabilities only.
- No authentication layer is present, so the service must remain loopback-only.
- No inventory collector or privileged helper has been implemented.
- No application, backup, migration, firewall, package, storage, Docker, or VM action is executed.
