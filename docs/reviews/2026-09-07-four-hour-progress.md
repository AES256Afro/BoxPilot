# Four-hour reliability implementation

Window: 2026-09-07 12:29:10-16:29:10 UTC. Continue accepted priorities, testing each slice. Production remains unchanged unless a later authorized release/deployment is performed. This log records implementation, not elapsed-time completion.

## First slice: connection bounds, secret expiry, resource inspection

- M32.4: incremental helper replies, 32 MiB frame ceiling, hard overall deadline, and queue heartbeat discard; account/global SSE budgets, buffered-byte/stall bounds, Unicode-preserving output chunks and cleanup after flush/close.
- M29.2: 30-minute deadline for secret-bearing approvals, persisted non-secret expiry metadata, minute cleanup, restart-safe approval refusal, and visible dialog expiry. Physical cleanup is on the next minute sweep; authorization expires at the deadline.
- M32.1 first slice: manual Repair Center resource check; web/helper heap, RSS, external and Linux file-cache/anonymous accounting; CPU interval, version, OOM, pressure and resource-type data in the API. No recurring disk scan or extra child process.
- M32.2 first slice: shared-cache counters and helper request counts, without cached values or credentials in diagnostic metadata.
- Documentation: RUNTIME-DIAGNOSTICS.md. The roadmap distinguishes local implementation from deployment and remaining trend/soak work.

Validation: npm run check passed with 1,468 tests across 217 files, including build, TypeScript, syntax, lint and shell checks. Built desktop demo: manually opened Repair, ran Check resource use, and verified distinct heap and Linux file-cache rows. Demo values are fictional. Production execution and long-duration soak remain unverified.

Next: finish partial source availability and coalescing/invalidation, then independent recovery/doctor tools. Also review the new paths for response cleanup and expiry edge cases before release. A heartbeat for this task resumes work if idle, and must stop starting new slices at 16:29:10 UTC.
